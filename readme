# Santander Dev Week 2023 – IA Project

This repository contains a simple project developed during the **Santander Dev Week 2023** bootcamp.

The main goal of the project is to practice:
- API consumption
- Basic ETL concepts (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Integration with an AI API (OpenAI)
- Project structure and organization in Python

## ⚠️ Known Issue

At the moment, the AI integration may not work as expected due to **API quota / billing limitations** on the OpenAI side.

If you run the project and receive errors like:

this is expected and related to missing or exhausted API credits, not to the project structure itself.

## 🧠 Project Flow (High Level)

1. **Extract**
   - Fetch users from a local API (`/users`)
2. **Transform**
   - Generate a short personalized investment message using AI
3. **Load**
   - Update the user data back to the API

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Requests
- OpenAI SDK
- Virtual Environment (`venv`)

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
